Description

What is the project you want to develop? (Description in less than 250 words)

Artinerary is a web application, location-aware platform that helps users discover, plan, and share visits to art-centric venues. By combining an interactive map, crowdsourced reviews, real-time itinerary building, hosting events, and communicating with each other. The app turns urban exploration into a social experience. Users can add unlisted spots, post multimedia reviews, create single-site events or multi-stop itineraries (events), and invite friends or the public.
Built-in group chat and smart recommendations keep everyone coordinated and inspired, along with privacy controls that let hosts decide who sees or joins each event.
Artinerary’s mission is to spotlight hidden artistic gems, foster creative communities, and make art discovery effortless for enthusiasts, influencers, and casual wanderers alike.

What is/are the problem/s you want to solve?

Fragmented information: Art venues, reviews, and events are scattered across unpopular platforms and sources, making discovery time-consuming.
Hidden gems stay hidden: Lesser-known artists and locations lack a channel to reach interested audiences.
Quick Planning: Build and customize an interesting plan that matches time, budget, and aesthetic goals usually requires several apps or manual mapping.
Community Building: finding like minded or interested people to go to art exhibits
Social coordination gap: Groups struggle to agree on venues, share updates, and keep conversations in one place.
Limited personalization: Existing travel apps rarely tailor suggestions to artistic interests.
User Personas and Major Features

Who are the users you are targeting? - Identify a few user personas .  Hint: There is usually more than one “type” of users. If you see only one type of user, think again

Art Enthusiasts & Explorers:
Learned people about the field → People interested in specific artists/designers
Newbies → people who want to roam around and see such locations
Aesthetic Photo Cravers:
Influencers →  separate because they would be searching places based on a theme
Someone who just wants to have good photos
Wanderers (just want a place, might not even care about the art):
People planning an activity for a group of people
People looking for something cheap / free to do

Who are the major features you are targeting? - Identify major functionality per user type

For Art Enthusiasts & Explorers:  
Display nearby places on a map 
Provide a section (reviews section) where they can understand the perspectives and opinions of like-minded people – and, also share their own
A feature of adding a non-listed place - If they find such a worthwhile place
A feature for scheduling and posting events on the platform in order to meet like-minded people. 
A chat feature to coordinate meets or just generally chat with like-minded people.

For Aesthetic Photo cravers:
Map of nearby places and the images related to those places which will help them choose a place which aligns for their content / or just choose a place which they like more.
If they want multiple photos, they can use the itinerary feature to roam around multiple such places, according to their requirements.

Wanderers (just want a place, might not even care about the art):
Map of nearby places and its images to choose a place where they can “chill”
If they want to roam around multiple such places, they can use the  itinerary feature (Gen-AI) which will curate plans based on their current location.
MVP(Minimum Viable Product)

		- RESTRICTED → send invitations to usernames/email

MLP (Minimum Loveable Product)
Which features are a really nice to have to the users would fall in love with the product

A real-time itinerary to roam around such places, based on the user’s current location.

For People who have accepted an invitation for an event - they can chat in a GROUP CHAT and have a "Flash - Chat" feature.

Saving itineraries → Can save itineraries directly from chatbot or create own itineraries and customize them in a Notes-like environment 

For a location → “add to itinerary/event  || current/new” button → which gives you the list of saved itineraries  → from which you select one

Nice-To-Haves Features - Not MVP, not MLP but still would be cool to develop these features
