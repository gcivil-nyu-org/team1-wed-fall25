# Artinerary Development Summary

## Project Overview

**Artinerary** is a full-featured Django web application for discovering and sharing public art in NYC. Built following traditional Django patterns with server-side rendering, it demonstrates clean code architecture, OOP principles, and lean development practices.

## Development Approach

### Philosophy
- **Lean Code**: Minimum viable implementation for each feature
- **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, well-structured
- **OOP Reuse**: Shared base templates, form mixins, admin inheritance
- **Django Conventions**: Standard app structure, built-in features first

### Tech Constraints (per Rulebook)
- ✅ Django templates only (no React)
- ✅ Traditional Django app structure

## Architecture Highlights

### Code Reuse Patterns
1. **Base Template**: All pages extend `base.html`
2. **Form Patterns**: Consistent form rendering across apps
3. **Permission Decorators**: `@login_required` on mutations
4. **Admin Inlines**: Consistent inline editing (photos, items, locations)
5. **Generic Views**: Function-based for flexibility, consistent patterns

### Database Design
- **Indexes**: lat/lng, created_at, source_id
- **Denormalization**: average_rating, review_count on Location
- **Unique Constraints**: (user, location) for Review, Favorite
- **Generic FK**: Report can target any model
- **Cascading Deletes**: Proper ON DELETE handling

### Security
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Permission checks before mutations
- Owner-only edit/delete
- Visibility enforcement (public/restricted/private)
- SQL injection protection (ORM)
- XSS protection (template escaping)

### Performance
- Pagination (20 items per page)
- select_related() and prefetch_related()
- Database indexes on common queries
- Denormalized aggregates
- Minimal JavaScript (no heavy bundles)

## Django Template Approach

### What Works Well
- ✅ Server-side rendering (SEO-friendly)
- ✅ No build pipeline needed
- ✅ Template inheritance and includes
- ✅ Form rendering with widgets
- ✅ Flash messages
- ✅ CSRF built-in

### Progressive Enhancement
- Base functionality without JavaScript
- Enhanced UX with minimal JS:
  - Leaflet for maps
  - SortableJS for drag-drop
  - Fetch API for AJAX
- All features degrade gracefully

### Limitations Navigated
- No client-side routing → full page loads
- No virtual DOM → AJAX for partial updates
- No state management → server holds state
- Component reuse → template tags and includes

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why PostgreSQL?
- JSON fields (future expansion)
- Full-text search capabilities
- Geospatial extensions (future)
- Production-ready

### Why Leaflet + OSM?
- No API keys required
- Free tiles
- Lightweight (38KB gzipped)
- Well-documented

### Why Function-Based Views?
- More explicit and flexible
- Easier to understand for team
- Better for mixed GET/POST logic
- Class-based would be over-engineering

### Why Django Admin?
- Free moderation interface
- Customizable
- Staff-only by default
- Reduces development time

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. Incremental milestone approach
2. Git commits per milestone (clean history)
3. Documentation alongside code
4. Lean implementation (no gold-plating)
5. OOP reuse (forms, templates, admin)

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Drag-drop ordering**: Solved with SortableJS + AJAX
2. **Generic reporting**: ContentType FK for flexibility
3. **Event visibility**: Query-level enforcement + view checks
4. **Photo uploads**: Formsets with DELETE support
5. **Map interaction**: Click-to-place on forms

### Time Savers
- Django admin for moderation
- CDN libraries (no npm)
- Management commands for seeding
- Django ORM (no raw SQL)
- Built-in auth system

## Testing Strategy (Outline)

### Unit Tests (To Implement)
- Model constraints and validators
- Form validation
- Permission checks
- Signal handlers (profile creation, rating updates)

### Integration Tests (To Implement)
- View workflows (create → edit → delete)
- RSVP and invitation flows
- Report submission
- Seeding command

### Manual Testing (Completed)
- All CRUD operations
- Map interactions
- Drag-drop ordering
- Permission enforcement
- Email sending (console)
