## Database State
- Report table created with generic FK
- Migrations applied successfully

## Technical Notes
- GenericForeignKey allows reporting any model
- Type mapping in view: location → locations.Location, etc.
- Django admin used for moderation (no custom UI needed for MVP)
- Future: staff moderation dashboard
- Future: email notifications to staff on new reports
